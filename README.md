# TUD_rotational_chair
An user interface to control the rotational chair in ME, TU Delft.

This software is dedicated to the hardward / firmware located in ***room 34 F-0-430(A)*** in TU Delft.

The equipment is specialized in earth-vertical rotation. It can be programmed to perform a complex 1-dimension motion.

## Application
### Time Constant (of Oman[1]'s Model) Measurement
A recovery time experienced by participants after a continuous rotating can be recorded with the equipment.

### Sum-of-sines Stimulus (Keshner[2]'s Motion) Performance
A period of unpredictable rotations in the earth-horizontal plan designed by FA Keshner(1995) is embedded in this software.
